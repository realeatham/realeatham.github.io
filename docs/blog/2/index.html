            <h1 id="title">Big spreadsheet of mobile plans in Australia!</h1>
            <p>Recently I made a spreadsheet with information for every mobile plan and provider in australia I could find. It has data on Plan data caps, price, price/gb/month, speed caps, Rollover / Data banking amounts, and how much texting and calling you can do. I made so people can easily compare prices for mobile plans like you can with NBN plans (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_wnaTFb_3QsdgZfKDrEO6D_Rpzt2clbB/edit?gid=1523306688#gid=1523306688">This Spreadsheet</a> for that (not made by me)). I plan to update it occasionally, maybe once every year or 6 months. </p>
            <h2 id="download">Where to get it</h2>
            <p>You can download it in this repo: <a href="https://codeberg.org/libre-net-au/isps">https://codeberg.org/libre-net-au/isps</a></p>
